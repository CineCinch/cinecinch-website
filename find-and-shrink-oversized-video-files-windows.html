        <h1>How to Find and Shrink Oversized Video Files on Windows Without Losing Quality</h1>
        <p>
            If you work with screen recordings, phone clips, or exported projects, your drives can fill up fast.
            Some videos are huge for a good reason, but others are quietly wasting space — using far more megabytes
            per second than they need to. In this guide, we’ll look at how to <span class="inline-highlight">find the true
            space hogs</span> on Windows and shrink them without visible quality loss.
        </p>
    </header>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>Why some videos are much bigger than they need to be</h2>
        <p>
            Video file size is mostly driven by three things:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Resolution</strong> (e.g., 1080p vs 4K)</li>
            <li><strong>Duration</strong> (how long the video is)</li>
            <li><strong>Bitrate</strong> (how many bits per second are used to encode it)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Two files can have the same resolution and duration but wildly different sizes. That usually means one of them
            is <span class="inline-highlight">inefficient</span> — it’s using more megabytes per second than it needs to for the
            actual content on screen.
        </p>
        <p>
            The trick is not just to find “big files”, but to find the ones that are <em>unreasonably</em> big for their length.
            That’s where looking at <strong>MB per second</strong> becomes much more useful than just sorting by size.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>Common ways to shrink video files on Windows</h2>
        <p>
            There are three main approaches people use to reduce video file size on Windows:
        </p>
        <h3>1. HandBrake (powerful, but manual)</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>HandBrake</strong> is a popular open-source transcoder. You can load a file, pick a preset, and export a smaller version.
            It’s powerful and free, but it has a lot of knobs: codecs, bitrates, CRF values, filters, and more.
        </p>
        <div class="tip">
            HandBrake is great if you’re comfortable tweaking encoding settings and working file-by-file. It’s less ideal
            when you just want to quickly clean up a messy folder full of oversized videos.
        </div>

        <h3>2. ffmpeg (flexible, but very technical)</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>ffmpeg</strong> is the command-line engine behind many video tools. You can use it directly to compress videos, for example:
        </p>
        <pre><code>ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx265 -crf 24 -c:a copy output.mp4</code></pre>
        <p>
            This tells ffmpeg to re-encode the video using H.265 (HEVC) at a given quality level while copying the audio.
            It’s extremely flexible, but you have to be comfortable with the command line and know which options to use.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Online video compressors (convenient, but slow and risky)</h3>
        <p>
            There are many browser-based tools that let you upload a video and download a smaller version. They’re convenient,
            but they come with trade-offs:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Uploading large files is slow and bandwidth-heavy</li>
            <li>Privacy concerns (you’re sending your content to a third-party server)</li>
            <li>File size limits and queues</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            For large libraries or sensitive content, online tools are usually not a great fit.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>Why “sort by size” isn’t enough</h2>
        <p>
            On Windows, the usual first step is to open File Explorer and sort a folder by size. That’s a start, but it doesn’t
            tell you which files are actually <em>inefficient</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            A 4 GB, 2-hour movie might be perfectly reasonable. A 4 GB, 5-minute screen recording is probably not. What you really
            want to know is:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>How many megabytes per second each video is using</li>
            <li>Which files are outliers compared to the rest of your library</li>
            <li>Which ones will give you the biggest space savings if you compress them</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            That’s where tools that understand <strong>MB/sec inefficiency</strong> become much more useful than just a file size column.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>Finding the worst offenders by MB/sec automatically</h2>
        <p>
            One way to do this manually is to inspect each file’s bitrate and duration, then calculate size per second yourself.
            That’s tedious and doesn’t scale when you have hundreds of clips.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>CineCinch</strong> is a Windows app built specifically to solve this problem. Instead of just listing files by size,
            it scans your folders and ranks videos by <span class="inline-highlight">inefficiency in MB/sec</span> — effectively answering:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>“Which videos are using way more space per second than they should?”</li>
            <li>“Which files will give me the biggest win if I compress them?”</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="video-placeholder">
            <!-- Replace this with your actual embedded video/thumbnail -->
            <p><strong>Demo:</strong> CineCinch scanning a folder, ranking oversized videos, and shrinking the worst offenders.</p>
        </div>

        <p>
            Instead of guessing, you get a sorted list of the biggest offenders. You can then queue those for compression and
            ignore the files that are already efficient.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>Shrinking oversized videos with H.265 (HEVC)</h2>
        <p>
            Once you’ve identified the worst offenders, the next step is to re-encode them more efficiently. A common choice is
            <strong>H.265 (HEVC)</strong>, which can deliver similar visual quality to H.264 at a much lower bitrate.
        </p>
        <p>
            In CineCinch, you can:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Scan a folder and rank videos by MB/sec inefficiency</li>
            <li>Select the ones that are clearly oversized for their duration</li>
            <li>Queue them for H.265 compression using simple presets</li>
            <li>Keep audio and subtitle tracks if you want</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Everything runs locally on your machine — no uploads, no cloud processing, no telemetry.
        </p>
        <div class="tip">
            Example: A 3-minute screen recording that was originally 1.2 GB might shrink to around 220 MB with no obvious
            quality loss, freeing up space quickly when you batch this across many similar files.
        </div>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>Manual vs automated workflows: when to use which</h2>
        <p>
            If you only have a handful of files and you like full control, HandBrake or ffmpeg are great options. You can tune
            every parameter and inspect each result.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you have <em>folders</em> full of mixed content — screen recordings, exports, clips from different devices — an automated
            workflow that:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Finds the most inefficient videos by MB/sec</li>
            <li>Lets you queue them quickly</li>
            <li>Runs locally without babysitting</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            will save you a lot of time and guesswork.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>Tips for keeping video sizes under control</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Use efficient codecs:</strong> Prefer H.265/HEVC when your playback devices support it.</li>
            <li><strong>Match resolution to content:</strong> Don’t store low-detail screen recordings at 4K if 1080p is enough.</li>
            <li><strong>Watch MB/sec, not just GB:</strong> A short, huge file is often a better compression candidate than a long movie.</li>
            <li><strong>Batch process:</strong> Queue multiple oversized files at once instead of handling them one by one.</li>
